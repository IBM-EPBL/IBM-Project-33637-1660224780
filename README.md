Signs with Smart Connectivity for Better Road Safety

Project Description:
-> To replace the static signboards, smart connected sign boards are used.
-> These smart connected sign boards get the speed limitations from a web app using weather API and update automatically.
-> Based on the weather changes the speed may increase or decrease.
-> Based on the traffic and fatal situations the diversion signs are displayed.
-> Guide(Schools), Warning and Service(Hospitals, Restaurant) signs are also displayed accordingly.
-> Different modes of operations can be selected with the help of buttons.
